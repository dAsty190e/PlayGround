pokeman game

// objective
the object of this lesson is to reinforce your understanding of classes and using their state/behavior (properties/methods).
you are going to create an arena where user will select 2 pokenam to fight
each pokeman will be its own class
all pokeman will have at least the following state: a Name, HP, and AP
all pokeman will have a attack method and two other special action methods
the game will start by having the user select which pokeman they want to fight
one the pokeman is selected, the combat loop will begin
the combat look will just be a loop of each pokeman taking 1 action
the loop ends when either pokenmans HP is 0 and the winner is declared

// combat rules
the attack method will cost 0 AP
special attacks will cost varying AP
if a pokeman attempts to perform a special action but does not have enough AP, it will just attack instead

// core programing concepts
what is the difference between a class and an object (or instance)
how do we create an instance of a class
what is a property
what is a method
what is the general structure of a method
loops (iteration or enumeration)

// extra ideas
class constructors
class fields
interfaces would make the combat loop much easier
consider regenerating some AP per combat round
random damage
